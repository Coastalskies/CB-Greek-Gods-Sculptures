## About the Greek Gods & Deities Collection

This collection focuses on ancient Greek statues and busts, with an emphasis on depictions of prominent mythological figures of relevant Greek Gods. These works can be dated from the Archaic period (c. 500 BCE) through the Hellenistic period (as late as 10 BCE). While also including some pieces that transition into early Roman times (27 BCE–14 CE). All of these show some pieces that depict early Greek civilization. Each item in our collection includes information like name, time period, location, and creator. This theme is important because it shows how ancient Greeks saw their gods and overall heroes—portraying their beauty, heroism, and divinity. This collection can analyze trends over time in terms of style features and the visualization of Greek Gods. We want to avoid having duplicates in our collection to show a very broad range of different figures and gods across Greek culture and time periods. 


The intended audience of this collection would be high school and college instructors of art history or world history realms. A high school teacher could use this collection to help their students visualize Greek Gods during a mythology section, while a college professor could show the changes from various time periods. The students can also analyze the differences in sculpting techniques by location or time period as well. All of these items in our collection come from public domain museum archives and university digital repositories like The British Museum. Our descriptions of our items are meant to give a brief description of the type of sculpture and exactly what the creator was attempting to portray their god doing. All of this is done in hopes of giving our target audiences a better overview and more informative ideas about that item.
